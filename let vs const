in the old days , if we want to declare a variable in javascript, well use the var keyword. var
stands for variable. However in the recent flavour of javascript we don't need to use the var keyword anymore
Var is used for global variable, Global variables are the ones that can be used anywher in the program.

let is a relatively new keyword in javascript used to declare variables, it is preferred to the var keyword.
both let and const are block-scoped i.e. they only exist within the block of code where they are defined

{
  let x = 5;
  const y = 15;
  //both x and y are accessible here
}

// x and y are not accessible here

a major differences between let and const is that with let we can declare a variable that can be reassigned
throughout the program.

let x = 5;
let x = 10; 
console.log(x); // this would log 10 to the console.

as regarding the const, it is used to declare variables that would not change in the program,
